## Indeterminate Checkboxes

For working demo, see https://css-tricks.com/examples/IndeterminateCheckboxes/

For swell tutorial, see https://css-tricks.com/indeterminate-checkboxes/

When I went to those links, I couldn't just copy and paste the provided code into my existing app and have it work...
This is a really complicated recursion project (from the perspective of a backend ruby dev)
so I finally refactored the source tutorial code, and was then able to drop it into my web app.  
Bottom line, I'm sharing the cleaned up (it's in a ruby-javascript dialect) code so other's can re-use it with out spending too much time.
